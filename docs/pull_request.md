### Requirements for Contributing a Bug Fix

* Fill out the template below. Any pull request that does not include enough information to be reviewed in a timely manner may be closed at the maintainers' discretion.
* The pull request must only fix an existing bug or a enhancement or a documentation change.
* The pull request must update the test suite to demonstrate the changed functionality.
* After you create the pull request, all status checks must be pass before a maintainer reviews your contribution. Please follow the proper coding standards for the same.

### Identify the Bug

<!--

Link to the issue describing the bug that you're fixing.

If there is not yet an issue for your bug, please open a new issue and then link to that issue in your pull request.
Note: In some cases, one person's "bug" is another person's "feature." If the pull request does not address an existing issue with the "bug" label, the maintainers have the final say on whether the current behavior is a bug.

### Description of the Change

<!--

We must be able to understand the design of your change from this description. If we can't get a good idea of what the code will be doing from the description here, the pull request may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the concepts.

### Documentation

<!--

Please include the documentation along with each bug fix or enhancement. Else create a separate issue for the documentation. It is best to have documentation with each bug fix or enhancement as it would give clearer picture to the maintainer.
This would be part of the official documentation of [I3](https://github.com/ANRGUSC/iotm)
